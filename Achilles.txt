Christian Minotti ( https://www.facebook.com/ci.emme.73 ) posted this on his Facebook, and it made me laugh so much, I decided to translate it from Italian (with a little help from Google). Enjoy!

- Achilles!
- Oh, king Agamemnon himself, to what do I owe the honor?
- We're about to attack and I wanted to know if the strongest of our warriors is ready to jump into the fray.
- I'm always ready.
- That's what I wanted to hear. Well, here's how we'll proceed: war chariots and archers will move in a line... what is this?
- This?
- Yes, this.
- It's my armor. Forged by Hephaestus himself. Do you like it?
- Well, it's definitely a work of art, but sorry...
- What?
- Heel protectors...
- I don't wear them.
- Please, let's not get into this argument again.
- I told you I wouldn't wear them, and I'm not wearing them.
- Achilles, please, I did ask you one thing! Just one! To put those bloody heel protectors on!
- I feel suffocated by heel protectors.
- The thing is, it's biologically impossible to feel suffocated at the heels!
- But I do, I breathe a lot with my feet.
- Listen to me. Reason with me for a second, okay? You are invincible...
- Very invincible.
- Very, yes, excellent. Except for one point.
- One point.
- And the point is...?
- What's the point?
- No, I mean there is one point...
- The heel?
- Yes, the heel. Damn you! You can go out there naked and fight these wretches! I saw with my very eyes someone pull a sword on your dick and the sword broke in two. But you have to wear the heel protectors, my son.
- Or what?
- Say someone shoots you in the heel with an arrow.
- You want to tell me that, if I go out now, one of those incompetent archers, one of the Trojans, will shoot me right in the heel? Frankly, it seems statistically improbable.
- But, you see, they shoot a thousand arrows a day, so why take a chance?
- I don't think there's a risk. And this heel thing-- you don't even know if it's true.
- Of course it's true! Your mother told me that when she dunked you, she was holding you by the heel, and she couldn't spare those two seconds to turn you around... Anyway, the other day you bumped your heel into a piece of furniture and you almost had a stroke ..... I don't think it was a coincidence.
- Exaggeration. They want me to look weak. I'm used to fighting without protectors, and you can't expect me to change my habits like this, overnight.
- But this is your life we're talking about.
- No one has ever died from an arrow to the heel. There are no vital organs in the heel.
- But there are! And you can! That's how this works! It's the whole Achilles character concept! Remember when we went to the Oracle of Delphi?
- Yes, yes.
- What did the Oracle of Delphi say?
- ...
- What did it say?
- It said to put on the heel protectors.
- So put the damn heel protectors on!
- I don't trust the Oracle of Delphi. You don't know who finances it.
- And then we went to the Oracle of Olympia, and what did the Oracle of Olympia tell you?
- To put the heel protectors on. Come on, you know that the Oracle of Olympia is politically motivated.
- Even Asclepius told you so!
- I don't trust Asclepius. He doesn't seem professional to me.
- He's the god of medicine!
- Exactly. You can be sure that someone like him would promote their own interests. There's big business behind it, don't you think so? Half of the Peloponnese are packing heel protectors.
- Be reasonable, we went through twenty oracles, seers, and semi-divinities. Damn you, everyone told you to put the heel protectors on. They didn't say, "put them on, otherwise you lose the battle," or "put them on, otherwise your wife will catch an infection," or "your son will screw a sea monster," or "your aunt will go off the road in a chariot." No! Put them on or else you die!
- You forget about the Oracle of San Raffaele.
- What is the Oracle of San Raffaele?
- The one with crystal therapy.
- Oh yeah, that.
- He said I cannot wear it.
- One! One out of twenty! Which is also "sort of" an Oracle. Do you remember that he had dream catchers hanging everywhere? His temple was in the back of a herbalist shop, come on...
- I don't care. I feel humiliated wearing heel protectors, I feel constrained. Tiresias said the same thing.
- Tiresias, the blind fortune teller?
- Yes, yes. He said these heel protectors are a violation of my rights.
- Forget Tiresias, he's old, he may sings well but, for god's sake, these things are not his specialty. I would take anything he says with a grain of salt. The health advice from someone in the Hades?
- There's no use trying to convince me. I'm not going to walk around with heel protectors and have people laugh behind my back.
- But it's such a small inconvenience. Come on, just make a little effort, that's all I ask. And we win this war. And then we all go back to the way we lived before. Do you want to go back to that life?
-... yes.
- So will you wear them?
- Absolutely not!
...
- Achilles is dead, and I'm honored that he chose me to share the memories of him at his funeral rite. Achilles was the strongest and most valiant of us, but he was also proud and reckless. If he had paid a little more attention, if he had been less selfish, less stubborn, he would still be alive, and with him many others who followed him to the Lake Avernus during this scary war. Maybe his end can teach us, those who he has left behind, something of value. Maybe he can teach us not to make rush judgments, to listen with humility to those who know more than us, to those who dedicated their whole life to knowledge to help us live better lives. Or he can teach us that none of us are truly immortal, even if sometimes we tend to think otherwise. And that--in war--everyone is responsible not only for their own lives, but also for the lives of others. So today, remembering this great leader, we try to remember not to be arrogant or shallow about fate, about gods and, above all, about death.
- Beautiful speech, Ulysses.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Where will you go now?
- The war is over. I'm going home.
- Do you need a navigator?
- Come on! It's just straight sailing!
