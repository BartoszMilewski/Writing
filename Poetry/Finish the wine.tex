Are you throwing these paperbacks away?

I haven't finished that one

About a sinking ship

People rushing to lifeboats.

Don't tell me how it ends.

\bigskip


It's Davis, California

Hot summer, skin peeling off sycamore trees

You're cursing in Spanish

Laughing or crying?

Hard to tell now.

\bigskip
Are you going to eat that last olive?

If not, I'd like to hold on to it

A little longer.

Late night discussions about Wittgenstein

A coffee cup you gave me for my birthday

It's cracked now

But I still drink from it

Two chocolates

A kiss

Or was it a butterfly that touched my cheek?

\bigskip
Not this photograph, please

Can I have it?

A crab shell half buried in sand

Your footsteps, my footsteps

Smell of seaweed

Ashes left from a bonfire

\bigskip

Stay with me

Just a little bit longer, yes?

Finish the wine.
