Orphans

We left for the sleepy fields at the break of dawn
Marched shivering in single file
Before the fog lifted to reveal the pale sun
One nun leading, 
Another closing

We picked potatoes
That were left behind after autumn harvest
We gathered dried rhizomes
Started a bonfire

We threw potatoes into the flames
Watched sparks flicker and die
Stirred ambers with sticks
Watched crows hop away
Too tired to fly

The sun soon faded
The wind picked up and it started snowing.
One after another
The orphans froze
White lips blackened with potato ash.

The younger nun turned to me
"Take your time," she said in a sweet voice,
"Nobody's waiting."
