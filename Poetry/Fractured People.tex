I dream of

fractured people, they

are missing important parts,

they stumble, hitting

invisible obstacles, they break.

\bigskip

They're made of shards of glass

stained but pure

their colors sometimes show through

but mostly stay hidden

obscured by layers of soot and grime.

\bigskip

I try to wash the dirt hoping

that one day I'll create

a whole person out of

fragments.

One person

complete and perfect.

But I keep cutting myself

on sharp edges.

\bigskip

I dream of abandoned buildings

leaking roofs, moldy carpets.

Sometimes a junkie walks in,

collapses

on a soggy mattress,

falls asleep inside my dream.

\bigskip

I try to fix the doors,

unbreak the windows,

patch the ceilings,

dry the walls,

hoping that one day 

I'll be able to spare some dust

and hold it for a short while

in my hands

protected from wind 

and rain.

\bigskip

A junkie wakes up and leaves

I keep dreaming.
