We left for the sleepy fields at the break of dawn

Marched shivering in single file

Before the fog lifted to reveal the pale sun

One nun leading, 

Another closing

\bigskip

We picked potatoes

That were left behind after autumn harvest

We gathered dried rhizomes

Started a bonfire

\bigskip

We threw potatoes into the flames

Watched sparks flicker and die

Stirred ambers with sticks

Watched crows hop away

Too tired to fly

\bigskip

The sun soon faded

The wind picked up and it started snowing.

One after another

The orphans froze

White lips blackened with potato ash.

\bigskip

The younger nun turned to me

``Take your time,'' she said in a sweet voice,

``Nobody's waiting.''
