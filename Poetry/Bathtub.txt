We'll make you a model citizen
They said
Here are your pills
One in the morning
To forget the nightmares
One after work
To forget the humiliation
One before bed
So you can fuck your frigid wife
While she's texting her friends
About the shit she bought
With the money you earned
Donating blood
For rich people's pet lice

Smile
They said
Don't feel like shit
Double your dose if necessary
Watch more TV
Work around your problems
Avoid unnecessary thinking
Especially after dark
When you're lying with your eyes wide open
In a bed that smells like freshly dug ground

It's okay
They said
Some people get these thoughts
They ask themselves questions
Have doubts
About the choices they made
But it will pass
As soon as you get back to your safe routine
And lock the doors, and tape the windows shut

I forgot to take my pills
Carved a smile across my face 
With a razor blade
Left a mess in the sink
Left my frigid wife sobbing
Left my job
Left my body in a bathtub
